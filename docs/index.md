the hype of AI. It provides a wealth of great diagrams and visual aids to supplement
the clear explanations. The worked examples and code make concrete what other books
leave abstract. The book starts with simple introductory beginnings, and steadily builds in
scope. By the final chapters, you will be fine-tuning and building your own large language
models with confidence."</p>
