        <p class="quote">"If you’re looking to get up to speed in everything regarding LLMs, look no further! In
this wonderful book, Jay and Martin will take you from zero to expert in the history
and latest advances in large language models. With very intuitive explanations, great
real-life examples, clear illustrations, and comprehensive code labs, this book lifts the
curtain on the complexities of transformer models, tokenizers, semantic search, RAG,
and many other cutting-edge technologies. A must read for anyone interested in the
latest AI technology!"</p>

        <p class="quote">"Hands-On Large Language Models brings clarity and practical examples to cut through
the hype of AI. It provides a wealth of great diagrams and visual aids to supplement
the clear explanations. The worked examples and code make concrete what other books
leave abstract. The book starts with simple introductory beginnings, and steadily builds in
scope. By the final chapters, you will be fine-tuning and building your own large language
models with confidence."</p>
